# Linting

See

-   [remark-lint rules](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#rules)
-   [remark-lint config](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#configure) is handled in package.json

## Justification for linting rules in \[./package.json]:

For now we will just try the basic defaults with these packages:

-   https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended
-   https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent
