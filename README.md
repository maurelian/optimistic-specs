# The Optimistic Ethereum Spec

This repository holds the work-in-progress specification for the next version of
Optimistic Ethereum.

This spec is developed iteratively, specifying a rollup of increasing
complexity. The current stage specifies a "rollup" whose only transactions are
deposits (L2 transactions submitted on L1).

A more detailed, though potentially out of date specification can be found on
the `alpha` branch.

## Work in Progress

Please note that this specification is currently under heavy construction.
